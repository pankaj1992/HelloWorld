Hello World App using iOS Swift

App Platform - iOS
I have preferred to develop iOS mobile applications over other platforms because of multiple reasons. iOS, ran on Apple’s iPhone has always been a people’s favorite. With beautiful, seamless user design and experience, it truly engages the user from the lock screen to its many features. The simplicity iOS provides is unbeatable. Also, Apple’s quality app and prosperous music stores have always played a huge role in their success. Apple has always scanned and kept a close check on user made apps, ensuring continuous security for all of its app buyers. If at anytime a user has an issue with their iPhone, Apple is always willing at their store or one of their certified vendors. With consistent and frequent software updates, Apple always makes sure that their users update to quickly fix bugs and update/install new features. The seamless integration provided when connected with the user’s Mac PC/laptop is also a huge plus. iOS also features iMessage, and Facetime, exclusively available to iOS users, and extremely fast and simple. iOS also promises greater earnings prospects.

Version Control Repository - GitHub
Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. I prefer Git for personal app developments.
